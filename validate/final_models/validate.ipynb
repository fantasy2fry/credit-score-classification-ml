    "- hard voting\n",
    "Accuracy 0.74 on our dataset (yours 0.70). Overall i would say better results on our dataset.\n",

    "Same as with hard voting.\n",

    "### STACKING\n",
    "You could try different combinations of estimators (some that performed well in previous stages of modelling). Again better results on our dataset. Accuracy 0.73, precision 0.69, recall 0.73, f1 0.65. \n",
